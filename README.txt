Tic Tac Toe
===========

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe implementation in Jack. It plays as normally,
using the number keys to select which tile to "click". Player 1 is
arbitrarily the "X" piece and Player two the "O" piece. The other
controls are q to quit and r to reset the board (and scores). On the
left side of the screen is information of whose turn it is, an what
the current score is for each player.
